# Maze-Finder
Java algorithm that finds all possible paths within a maze with user input

Documentation:

The constants STARTX and STARTY denote the starting point within the maze,
the constants MARKED, OPEN and GOAL are the characters which dictate the
behaviour of the maze. Change these values to your liking and customization

The maze is initialised as a multidimensional array and is created manually from the user's input on the console
